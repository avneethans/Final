Hi! I’m **Avneet Hans**, a Kinesiology student at the University of Calgary with a passion for understanding how the human body moves and performs.

Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active, especially playing basketball and I’m always looking for ways to connect what I learn in class to real-world experiences. I’ve worked in clinical and research settings, where I developed strong communication, organization, and problem-solving skills while supporting healthcare teams and engaging with patients.

I’m passionate about helping others and applying both creativity and data analysis to explore human movement. Whether I’m building a maze game, analyzing fitness data, or breaking down sport performance on video, I love combining science and storytelling.

If you would like to get to know more about me and my employment experience, you can view or download my resume below:
