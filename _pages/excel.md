To explore the relationship between fatigue, performance, and injury among collegiate athletes, I used Excel to create a PivotTable and custom chart. This visualization summarizes key trends across player positions and highlights how different training and performance factors may contribute to injury risk.

### Visual Summary

![Injury Risk Chart](/Final/assets/images/chart.png)

This chart visualizes key metrics across different player positions (Center, Forward, Guard), including performance score, fatigue score, training intensity, and injury indicators. Guards showed the highest average performance and fatigue scores, with a moderate injury risk. Centers had slightly lower performance and fatigue levels but experienced fewer injuries overall. This analysis helps highlight the relationship between workload, fatigue, and injury across roles in team sports

You can view the Excel file below that includes the full dataset, pivot table, and graph:
